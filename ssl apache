Best option would be to open free Cloudflare account and move domains nameservers there
They automatically provide you with SSL certificate and attacks protection and you could disable ssl.conf on server

If you prefer to manage it on your own, I attached our dash domains script which generates new certificates and renew existing ones whenever required
Script also modifies the ssl.conf as required so you should back it up first

$db_path is where the domains list is stored. Blank file for each domain
Example:
# ls -l DB/DOMAINS/|head
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 19 15:15 datalbase.com
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Oct  1  2021 drive-photo.com
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 19 15:15 forexsmap.com
$db_path2 you should leave blank value unless you want to use another folder for separate domains

$pending_path is where new domains are added to
Once certificate is created, server will move it to $db_path

The .pem files should be stored in /etc/pki/tls/certs/

The vhosts.conf file content should be added to your ssl.conf before you run the script
It has 2 vhosts which should appear before all other vhosts. You can modify those vhosts if you'd like or keep as is
First vhost in file is catch-all that shows error page for users visiting https:// URL of domains that don't exist in ssl.conf such as 'https://server_ip' or 'https://domain_not_listed.com'
Second vhost is the api.appsway.net vhost. The script uses it as template for the added domains, so you must keep this part in ssl.conf

You should update or disable the sendmail part of this script
And backup the ssl.conf before running the script

If you don't already have Crypt::LE installed on server then you should run:
curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
cpanm Crypt::LE
